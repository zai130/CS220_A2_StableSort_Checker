# This program checks your function for Q1 of CS220 A2.
Outputs:
* Original list
* State of list after sorted
* If list is stable (Achieved using custom integer class)
* If list is sorted

I have implemented the given functions already, all you need to do is paste your function into stable_sort, and set the name of the unsorted_list to whatever you used.
